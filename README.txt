The program dice.py is written to simulate thrown die.  

First, it just prints a random number between 1 and 6.

Later, it does that and asks the user how many sides the dice has.

Next, it does the past two things + ask the user how many die are being rolled.

Afterwards, (create new branch) it asks the user how many dice there are, then asks how many sides each dice has (roll a 5 sided die and a 12 sided die). Write pseudo code.

Then, modify main version (go back to master branch)by making dice have at least two sides (no 1 sided or negative sided dice). Add shebang.

Now go to the branch with pseudo code and finish writing the real code.

Finally, merge the two master and smaller branches into one.
